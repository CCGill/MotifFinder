\title{Simulate DNA sequences with an enriched motif}
\usage{
simulate_sequences(motif, number_sequences = 300,
  sequence_length = 200, motif_position = NULL, enrichment = 0.5,
  jitter = 10, highprob = 0.85, lowprob = 0.6,
  randomstrand = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{motif}{character; string containing the motif sequence, can be upper or lower case ACGT or _}

\item{number_sequences}{numeric; number of sequences to generate}

\item{sequence_length}{numeric; length in bases of the sequences to be generated}

\item{motif_position}{numeric; start position of the motif in the sequences,
default is half the sequence length - half the motif width}

\item{enrichment}{numeric; what fraction of sequences should include the motif}

\item{jitter}{integer; how many base pairs to randomly +/- shift the position of the motif}

\item{highprob}{numeric; probability (between 0 and 1) of choosing a base when the motif has a capital/uppercase letter}

\item{lowprob}{numeric; probability (between 0 and 1) of choosing a base when the motif has a lowercase letter}

\item{randomstrand}{logical; should the strand of the motif be randomised (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
a character vector of random DNA sequences with an enriched motif
}
